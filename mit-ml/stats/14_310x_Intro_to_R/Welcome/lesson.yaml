  Output: Welcome to 14.310x, and welcome to R! This short interactive course is designed 
    to provide you with a solid introduction to R. Good Job figuring out the 
    installation processes, these can get messy sometimes! 
    Are you ready to get started? (If yes, hit the Enter key)

  Output: Great! Let's get to it. This course contains the required material which you will need to know in order
    to be able to complete the assignments. 
    There is another course, 14.310x Advanced R, which contains material which you may find helpful, though is not strictly
    required knowledge for this course.

  Output: The course is broken down into 9 modules, which you should have noticed at the home screen. 
    Each of these modules is about 15-20 min long, and will cover a specific set of topics. You can find the list 
    of topics and commands within each module on the 14.310x edx page. You are currently in the "Welcome" module.

  Output: To navigate your way out of a module, if you are at the R prompt (there is a > arrow at the beginning of the line), type "info()" in the command prompt
    to get a list of navigation options. Otherwise, you can return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. 
    Does that make sense?

  Output: Awesome! Make sure you use the same name when swirl asks "What should I call you?". 
    swirl automatically saves your progress, so you can quit and resume anytime without losing work.
    If you use a new name, it'll get you to start from scratch.

  Output: One last thing- The best way to learn how to program is to program! 
    While these modules will help to get you started, becoming fluent in R requires pratice. 
    We have designed 14.310x so that you will have ample opportunity to do so. We highly recommend that you do not copy and paste
    any commands from the swirl prompts, typing them out is a much better way to learn.
